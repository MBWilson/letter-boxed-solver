# Letter-Boxed Model-Based Reflex Agent

This Python project implements a model-based reflex agent for solving Letter-Boxed puzzles. 
It features a backtracking algorithm to generate all possible words within the game's constraints and utilizes a trie (prefix tree) data structure for efficient vocabulary traversal.

## Features

- Backtracking algorithm for word generation
- Trie (prefix tree) data structure for efficient vocabulary traversal
