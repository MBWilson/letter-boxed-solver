# Letter-Boxed Model-Based Reflex Agent

This Python project implements a model-based reflex agent for solving Letter-Boxed puzzles. 
It features a backtracking algorithm to generate all possible words within the game's constraints and utilizes a trie (prefix tree) data structure for efficient vocabulary traversal.

## Features

- Backtracking algorithm for word generation
- Trie (prefix tree) data structure for efficient vocabulary traversal
  
## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MBWilson/letter-boxed-solver.git

2. Ensure Python 3.12.2 is properly installed:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

4. Execute the program
   ```bash
   python main.py
   
5. Follow on screen-prompts to use the agent for a selected puzzle.
